### The Death Location (Specific)

Room 203, a 6-bed female dormitory on the second floor. Six single beds with metal frames, thin mattresses, mosquito nets. Dot's bed is in the corner by the window. Blue painted walls, ceiling fan, barred windows. Sheets are changed weekly; hers were changed that morning. The industrial detergent residue is strongest because the sheets weren't properly rinsed.

### Staff Knowledge
No awareness of danger. They're proud of their cleanliness upgrades. Raju used extra detergent because he thought more = cleaner. No one knows about the chemical sensitivity issue.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Peaceful, spiritual. Travelers discussing temples and boat rides. Chai served constantly. Slow mornings recovering from early ghat visits. Dorothy fits in here - older travelers are common.

### Night Vibe
Early to bed. Most travelers exhausted from early mornings and heat. Quiet conversations on rooftop. Doors locked by 10 PM. Safe feeling.

### Guest Demographics
Mix of ages - spiritual tourists tend to be older. Backpackers, yoga practitioners, photography enthusiasts. Many solo female travelers feel safe here.

### Reputation
Online reviews: "Cleanest budget place in Varanasi!" "Family-run gem" "Safe for solo women" "Great rooftop views" "Sheets always fresh - finally!" Recent uptick in cleanliness praise (directly related to new detergent).

Train from Delhi or flights to Varanasi airport. Auto-rickshaw from station (haggling required). Hostel in old city, narrow lanes, hard to find by vehicle.

### Check-in Process
Passport details written in physical ledger. Cash payment preferred. Room shown personally. Chai offered. House rules explained gently.

### Rules
No smoking inside, no outside food (fire risk), quiet after 10 PM, shoes off at door. All very reasonable.

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
Varanasi is accurately depicted as intense, spiritual, and confronting. The omnipresence of death (cremations) provides thematic irony. Industrial cleaning products in Indian guesthouses are a real thing.

### Cultural Sensitivity
Varanasi is deeply sacred - treat the spiritual elements with respect. Death here is viewed differently than in the West - it's a blessing to die in Varanasi. Don't make light of Hindu death rituals.

- Backpacker accounts of guesthouses in the old city
