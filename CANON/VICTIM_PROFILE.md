# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Dorothy "Dot" Pemberton
**Nickname/Handle:** None (doesn't do social media)
**Age:** 68
**Nationality:** British (Yorkshire)
**Occupation:** Retired librarian, now budget traveler

## Archetype
**Primary:** The Silver Backpacker

**Secondary traits:** Fiercely independent, painfully frugal, quietly judgmental of younger travelers

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Pride / Denial

**How it manifests:**
- Refuses to admit she's too old for hostel travel
- Won't acknowledge her increasing health sensitivities
- Dismisses early symptoms as "just getting on a bit"
- Never got properly tested for allergies - "didn't have allergies in my day"

**How it kills them:**
Her stubborn refusal to acknowledge her changing body means she doesn't recognize the early warning signs of anaphylaxis and doesn't carry an EpiPen she desperately needs.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'4", wiry and angular, surprisingly strong for her age
- **Hair:** Silver-gray, sensible short cut
- **Distinguishing features:** Reading glasses on a chain, deep smile lines, slightly arthritic hands
- **Typical outfit:** Practical hiking trousers, fleece vest, comfortable walking shoes, fanny pack (she calls it a bum bag)

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Independent - becomes stubborn refusal to ask for help
2. Frugal - becomes penny-pinching that puts her in dangerous accommodations

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Pride - won't admit when something's wrong
2. Denial about aging - ignores her body's signals

### Pet Peeves
- Wasteful young people
- Dirty hostels (ironic given her death)

### Fears
- Surface fear: Being seen as "too old" to travel
- Deeper fear: Becoming dependent, losing her autonomy

## Background

### Origin Story
Worked at Leeds Central Library for 42 years. Widowed at 60 when husband Harold died of a heart attack. Grieved for three years, then decided to do everything they'd planned to do together. Has been budget traveling for five years now, staying in hostels because "hotels are a waste of good money."

### Why They Travel
Originally to honor Harold's memory. Now to prove she's still capable, still relevant. Running from the empty house and the silence. Terrified that if she stops moving, she'll simply cease to exist.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Following the classic "hippie trail" Harold always talked about. This hostel had good reviews from other senior travelers. "Clean sheets" was specifically mentioned.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "proper," "sensible," "in my day," "young people these days"
- Avoids words like: Slang of any kind, profanity (though she thinks it)
- Catchphrases: "Well, I never..." / "That's not how we did it..."

### Speech Pattern
- Clipped, efficient sentences
- Yorkshire accent emerges when frustrated
- Polite but with underlying steel

### Internal Monologue Style
Running commentary on everything, comparing to "back home." Defensive about her age while constantly aware of it.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** None - "Don't trust it"
- **Follower count:** N/A
- **Posting style:** N/A
- **Last post before death:** N/A - Her niece posts updates on her behalf to Facebook

### Online vs Reality
No online presence. Her reality IS her reality - unfiltered, uncommented upon, unwitnessed except by herself.

## Relationships

### Family
- Niece Sarah who worries constantly and texts daily (Dot replies once a week)
- No children - "Never wanted them, never had them"

### Friends
- Fellow travelers she meets briefly then never sees again
- Former library colleagues who think she's gone "a bit mad"

### Romantic
- Widow. Still wears her wedding ring. Still talks to Harold.

### At the Hostel
- Tries to mother younger travelers (who find it annoying)
- Impresses staff with her stamina
- Gets bottom bunk because "these old knees don't do ladders"

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Early riser. Makes tea with the travel kettle she carries. Writes in her journal. Plans the day meticulously. Notes the lovely fresh smell of her newly changed sheets.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Crawling into bed early (8:30 PM), exhausted from a day of temple visits. The sheets are crisp and cool against her skin. She thinks: "This is nice. Clean sheets. Harold would have appreciated this."

### Final Thoughts
"This isn't... I can't... Sarah... Harold, is that you? Harold, I'm coming..."

### Last Words
"Help—" (barely a whisper, throat closed)
